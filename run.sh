# Launch the Kodak/Pakon TLX Client natively on macOS.
#
#   real OEM software (TLXClientDemo.exe + tlx.dll + TLB.dll + PakonImau ...)
#     running under Wine 11
#       with pkusb.dll intercepting the five \\.\Pakon135 device calls
#         forwarded over a local socket to pakonusb.py
#           which drives the scanner with libusb and enforces the safety rules.
#
# Usage:  ./run.sh          start server (if needed) and the client
#         ./run.sh install  ONE COMMAND: prerequisites, OEM stack, firmware,
#                           build, patch, registry -- everything but the scanner
#         ./run.sh psi      the same, but Kodak's full PSI application instead
#                           of the TLX client, from its own prefix (docs/PSI.md)
#         ./run.sh install-psi [--from <dir>]   install PSI into that prefix
#         ./run.sh doctor   check prerequisites; --install to fix them
#         ./run.sh make-app [dir]   build a double-clickable "Pakon Scanner.app"
#                           (default ~/Applications) that does all of this
#         ./run.sh import-reg <file.reg>   import a .reg using a macOS path
#         ./run.sh stop     stop both
#         ./run.sh log      tail both logs
#         ./run.sh trace    decoded live view of the hardware conversation
