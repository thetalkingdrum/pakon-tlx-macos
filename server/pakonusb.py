r"""pakonusb -- serve \\.\Pakon135 to the OEM TLX stack running under Wine.

Self-contained on purpose: pkusb.dll (inside the Wine process) intercepts
tlx.dll's and TLB.dll's five device calls and forwards them here over a local
socket; this side owns libusb.  Nothing outside this directory is needed.

Endpoints and IOCTLs, all read out of the OEM driver and cross-checked against
TLB.dll's call sites:

    0x222059  EP0 control transfer.  10-byte input struct:
              direction, requestType(1=class,2=vendor), recipient, reserved,
              bRequest, pad, wValue:u16, wIndex:u16
    0x222090  bulk OUT EP 0x01 then bulk IN EP 0x81 -- command/response channel
    0xFFFFFFFF  pseudo-code for ReadFile: bulk IN EP 0x86 (the image stream)

DEVICE SAFETY -- enforced here because this is the only place it can be:
  * The EEPROM is NEVER written.  It holds irreplaceable per-unit calibration.
    On wIndex 0x1234 only the known reads pass: request 0xA4 with wValue bit 0
    set (read setup), and request 0xA9 IN.  Anything else is dropped.
  * LED currents are clamped to the firmware's OWN ceilings, which depend on
    the board AND on whether IR is lit -- on a 0x24 F-135 that is R8/G8/B8/Ir8
    with IR on, a QUARTER of the 0x44 board's G/B limit.  Unknown board or
    unknown lamp state takes the strictest row, never the loosest.  LED wear is
    this unit's known failure mode.  Currents are set by a type-2 WRITE of
    register 0x81 whose 5-byte payload is [B, IR, R, _, G].
  * On exit the motor stop order rate=0 -> go -> idle is issued.  A bare stop
    does NOT halt the drive.
